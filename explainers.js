   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   A tiny, self-contained "What's this?" helper. Marketing terms (tone of
   voice, content pillars, CTA…) are second nature to a marketeer but opaque
   to the busy founder using the app. This drops a friendly 🦢 info icon next
   to any element that carries a `data-explain="<slug>"` attribute. Click /
   tap (or hover on desktop) pops a plain-English, Swan-flavoured explanation.

   Usage — just add the attribute, no per-call wiring:
     <label data-explain="brand-voice">Brand Voice & Tone:</label>

   The script injects its own CSS (so it never depends on the prebuilt
   Tailwind style.css) and re-scans on DOM changes, so it also covers the
   workspace view partials that are swapped in dynamically by loadView().

      term: 'X (Twitter) Strategy',

    },
    'content-formats': {
      term: 'Reels, Carousels & Static',
      emoji: '🎞️',

      term: 'Trending Audio',

      term: 'Link in First Comment',

      term: 'PDF Slider / Carousel',
      emoji: '📑',

    'media-placeholders': {
      term: 'Media Placeholders',
      emoji: '🖼️',
      plain: "Little reminders left in a draft post that say “add a photo or video here.” Posts with an image or clip get noticed far more, so the assistant flags the best spot for you to pop one in.",

    },
    'engagement': {
      term: 'Engagement',
      emoji: '❤️',
      plain: "How much people interact with your posts — likes, comments, shares, saves. It's the difference between people scrolling past and actually stopping to care. The app shows your stuff to more people when engagement is high.",
      example: 'e.g. "50 likes and 12 comments on your tips post."'
    },
    'reach': {
      term: 'Reach',
      emoji: '🌍',
      plain: "The number of different people who saw your post. Reach is about how far you spread — brand-new eyeballs, not the same fans seeing it twice.",

    },
    'impressions': {
      term: 'Impressions',
      emoji: '👀',

    },
    'conversion': {
      term: 'Conversion',
      emoji: '🎯',

    },
    'funnel': {
      term: 'The Funnel',
      emoji: '🥋',
      plain: "The journey from “never heard of you” to “happy customer.” It's wide at the top (lots of people discover you) and narrows down as people get more interested, then buy. Different posts help at different stages.",
      example: 'e.g. "A fun reel for discovery, a testimonial to convince, an offer to close."'
    },
    'lead-magnet': {
      term: 'Lead Magnet',
      emoji: '🧲',
      plain: "A handy freebie you give away in exchange for an email — a guide, checklist or template. It “attracts” interested people so you can stay in touch and sell to them later.",

    },
    'brand-assets': {
      term: 'Brand Assets',

    },
    'smart-goals': {
      term: 'SMART Goals',
      emoji: '🎯',
      plain: "Goals that are clear enough to actually hit — Specific, Measurable, with a deadline. “Grow my following” is a wish; “reach 1,000 followers by August” is a SMART goal your assistant can aim at.",

      term: 'Review Queue',

    },
    'response-formatting': {
      term: 'Response Formatting',
      emoji: '📝',
      plain: "How your assistant lays out what it writes — short paragraphs or long ones, emoji or none, bullet points or plain prose. This is the shape of the message, separate from the tone.",
      example: 'e.g. "Always use short paragraphs; never use technical jargon."'
    },
    'core-business-facts': {
      term: 'Core Business Facts',
      emoji: '📌',
      plain: "The must-get-right details about your business that your assistant should always have straight — what you sell, when you launched, prices, hours. Get these wrong once and it looks careless.",

      term: 'AI Generation',
      emoji: '🎨',
      plain: "Uses your AI credits — a generated image typically costs 1 credit and a generated video costs 5 credits. You'll be notified of how many credits you have left, and unused credits roll over month to month.",
