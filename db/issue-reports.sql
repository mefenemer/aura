-- Issue Reports (Testing-phase bug reporting) — user-submitted issues + admin triage.
--
-- While the product is in the testing phase, the workspace exposes a "Report an Issue"
-- side-menu item. Each submission captures: a free-text description, the location the
-- user was on when they hit the button (source_location/source_url — tells the developer
-- WHERE the issue was), and an optional screenshot (stored inline as a base64 data URL so
-- the feature works without S3/R2 being provisioned). Issues are stored against the user
-- so they can track progress; the admin owner is emailed on every new report.
--
-- Lifecycle (status): reported → fix_in_progress → fixed_ready_to_test → closed
--                     ↘ more_info_required (admin asks the user for detail) ↗
--                     ↘ roadmap (feature request promoted to the Feature Roadmap; see db/feature-roadmap.sql)
-- The threaded back-and-forth (admin status messages + user replies) lives in
-- issue_report_messages.
--
-- Idempotent: safe to re-run. Apply manually as the DB owner (no drizzle-kit push — see the
-- no-db:push rule; raw-SQL RLS policies must not be clobbered).

-- ── "Pass to Developer" AI auto-fix handoff ──────────────────────────────────
-- An admin can hand a reported issue to an AI developer agent (Claude Code) that
-- runs on a dev machine. The cloud only orchestrates: it queues the issue, a local
-- watcher claims it, fixes it on a branch, opens a PR and writes the result back.
--
--   dev_handoff_status: null      → never handed off
--                       queued    → admin pressed "Pass to Developer"; awaiting a runner
--                       in_progress → a runner has claimed it and is working
--                       completed → fix produced (see dev_branch / dev_pr_url / dev_result)
--                       failed    → the runner could not produce a fix (see dev_result)
--
-- The user-visible lifecycle (status) is unchanged: queueing moves it to
-- 'fix_in_progress' and a successful completion moves it to 'fixed_ready_to_test'.

-- ── Which runner is working this issue ───────────────────────────────────────
-- Several runners (scripts/dev-issue-fixer.mjs) can drain the queue at once — the
-- claim is a compare-and-swap so they never grab the same issue. These two columns
-- let the admin portal show WHO is fixing WHAT:
--   dev_runner_id        — identity of the runner that currently holds this issue
--                          (a fix claim OR a merge claim); e.g. "mac-studio:48213".
--                          Stamped on claim, cleared when the runner reports a result.
--   dev_runner_heartbeat — when that runner claimed the issue ("working since"). The
--                          fix runs Claude synchronously so there's no mid-fix ping;
--                          a claim far older than a normal fix flags a dead/stalled
--                          runner in the UI so the issue can be re-queued.

-- ── Merge the fix PR to staging ──────────────────────────────────────────────
-- After the AI produces a fix the issue no longer jumps straight to "Fixed & Ready
-- to Test". It parks at 'fix_in_progress' with dev_merge_status='ready' and a super-admin
-- presses "Merge to staging" in the ticket. That queues a merge the local watcher claims
-- and performs with `gh pr merge`; only once merged (and any migration applied) does the
-- issue advance to 'fixed_ready_to_test' and the reporter get notified.
--   dev_merge_status: null    → no PR / not applicable
--                     ready   → PR open, awaiting a super-admin to merge
--                     queued  → merge requested; awaiting the watcher
--                     merging → the watcher has claimed it and is merging

-- ── AI auto-fix runner health / session-limit recovery ───────────────────────
-- The "Pass to Developer" runner (scripts/dev-issue-fixer.mjs) fixes issues by shelling out
-- to the Claude Code CLI on a developer machine. That CLI has its own usage/session limit —
-- when it's exhausted the runner can't produce ANY fix, so re-queueing an issue just fails
-- again immediately. This table lets a runner report that block, park itself, and be resumed
-- from the admin portal once a Claude account with credit is logged in on the runner machine.
--
--   state: 'ok'              → runner healthy / working normally
--          'session_limited' → CLI hit its limit; runner has paused and stopped claiming
--
-- On a block the runner re-queues the issue it was on (dev_handoff_status → 'queued') and
-- records it as blocked_issue_id. A super-admin logs into a funded Claude account on the
-- runner machine and presses "Resume" (sets resume_requested = true); the runner verifies the
-- new login with a cheap probe call and, only on success, flips back to 'ok' and resumes —
-- the re-queued issue is then re-claimed automatically. No Claude credential is ever stored
-- here; this row only coordinates the human-in-the-loop re-login.
--
-- Idempotent: safe to re-run. Apply manually as the DB owner (no drizzle-kit push).
